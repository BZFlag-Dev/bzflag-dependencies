# BZFlag Dependencies

This repository contains third-party libraries that are needed to build BZFlag on Windows using Visual C++.


## Upstream

Here is a list of the upstream source locations:

* [c-ares](https://github.com/bagder/c-ares.git)
* [libcurl](https://github.com/bagder/curl.git)
* [PDCurses](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdcurses/files/pdcurses/)
* regex - Looks like it was some version from NetBSD. Haven't yet found the ideal location to pull a new version from, so I'm using what we had.
* [zlib](https://github.com/madler/zlib.git)

## Building the libraries

Building these libraries requires Visual Studio 2015 at present, since this is the compiler that BZFlag 2.4 uses. Run the buildVS2015.bat file and it should build the libraries. Output will go into a folder such as output-release-x86.
